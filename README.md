# 2048-game-using-pygame
The goal of this game is to achieve a number "2048".On every move a random number will be generated on random empty position.Only two consecutives boxes having same numbers can be added.The ranking in this game is based on no of moves.Lesser the moves,higher the rank.
The game has three windows that are startgame,instructions and ranking.
I've used pygame for GUI,numpy for working with array and mixer for background and onclick music.
Happy coding!
